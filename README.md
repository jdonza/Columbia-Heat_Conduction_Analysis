# Columbia-Heat_Conduction_Analysis
The Matlab scripts within this repository were created as part of a final project for a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) course that I took while studying for my Master's 
degree. The overall object of the project was to analyze the heat conduction in a turbine blade using the finite element analysis method. An analysis software called 
Abaqus was used to get the general element connectivity data and the nodal points of the mesh on the turbine blade. This information was then copy and pasted into the 
Matlab scripts which were set-up to perform the actual FEA calculations. Two plots were then generated in Matlab, one showing the mesh connectivity information and the 
other displaying a color-coded temperature plot. Both plots within this repository show the post-processing results of the coarse mesh. The fine mesh script 
performs the same mathematical operations as the coarse mesh script, except with a more refinred mesh from Abaqus. The results were compared and explained in a final 
report. For more information on the specific tasks of this assignment, please see the ".PDF" file included in this repository.
