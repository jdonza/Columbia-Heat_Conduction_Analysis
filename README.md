# Columbia-Heat_Conduction_Analysis
The Matlab scripts within this repository were created as part of a final project for a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) course that I took while studying for my Master's 
degree. The overall object of the project was to analyze the heat conduction in a turbine blade using the finite element analysis method. An analysis software called 
Abaqus was used to get the general element connectivity data and the nodal points of the mesh on the turbine blade. This information was then copy and pasted into the 
Matlab programs which were set-up to perform the actual FEA calculations. Two plots were then generated, one showing the mesh connectivity data and the other showing the temperature distribution within the turbine blade. Both plots within this repository show the post-processing results for the coarse mesh. The fine mesh script performs the same mathematical operations as the coarse mesh script, except with more refined nodal points from Abaqus. Lastly, the results were compared and explained in a final report. For more information on the specific tasks of this assignment, please see the ".PDF" file included in this repository.
